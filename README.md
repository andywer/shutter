# Shutter.sh Client Packages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andywer/shutter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andywer/shutter)

This repository is a monorepo that contains the client packages to work with the [shutter.sh](https://shutter.sh/) visual snapshotting service.

**The shutter.sh service is still in an early stage and invitation-only. You will need an access token to use it. Drop me a line if you are interested.**


## End user packages

### [@shutter/react](./packages/react/README.md)

The React component snapshotting package. Use it to write visual regression tests for your React UI.

### [@shutter/cli](./packages/cli/README.md)

The command line tool. Can be used to upload static pages to the service and retrieve files from it.

Not that interesting yet.
