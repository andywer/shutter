# Setup

Read the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide. It also covers how to write React component tests.


# Beyond Testing

With shutter you cannot only write visual component tests. You can also snapshot-test whole pages or render arbitrary web content.

That usage is currently beyond the scope of this document, though. Browse the package readme files if you are interested:

- [`@shutter/core` package](https://github.com/shuttersh/shutter/tree/master/packages/core) - for testing static web content
- [`@shutter/api` package](https://github.com/shuttersh/shutter/tree/master/packages/api) - for querying the shutter service manually


# Angular, Vue & others

Support for those frameworks is not implemented right now, should be fairly straight forward to do, though.

If you need support for an additional framework urgently, feel free to write a package and open a pull request. Contributions are always welcome.
